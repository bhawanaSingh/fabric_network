### Hyperledger Convector Suits
In this session we will discuss about the what *Hyperledger Convector* all about and why it is required for the hyperledger fabric devlopment. instead of writing go on traditional Go lang, Hyperledger Convector support the *Typescrit* for writing the chaincode and modelling language to make the project sckelton. 
Before going to stat this session let first work on some dependencies required to build your first application on hyperledger convector. 
#Dependencis/ Packages:
- Download the *VS Code Editor* for writing your smart contract.
- Download the NVM.
```
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/master/install.sh | bash
$ source ~/.profile 
$ nvm ls-remote
$ nvm install v10.16.3
$ node --version
```
or you can follow up the [link](https://tecadmin.net/install-nodejs-with-nvm/) to download NVM.
